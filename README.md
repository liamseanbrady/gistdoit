This simple Ruby utility takes a file on your local machine and turns it into a gist on Github.

I could have used gems to simplify the development process, but I'm not sure how much code that would have actually saved me writing, and it would have undoubtedly added a layer of complexity in terms of understanding the codebase, so I decided to use only libraries which are built in to Ruby itself.

### Things I would like to add in the future

- Allowing the user to select whether they would like a gist to be either secret or public.
- Listing all gists which the option of limited to a certain number of most recent.
- Editing a particular gist after selecting it by name.
